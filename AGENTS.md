# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Sharp edges found during Milestone 1 (trial balance review)

- The downstream `tally_get_ledger_vouchers` tool (in the sibling
  `tally_prime_mcp_server` repo, `src/tools/reads.ts`) returns a report
  envelope object (`{ source, company, ledgerName, ..., vouchers: [...] }`),
  not a bare array. Row fields are `partyLedgerName`, `counterLedgerName`,
  and `matchedLedgerName` — there is no `counterparty`/`ledgerName`/`party`
  field. `src/downstream.ts`'s `ledgerVouchers()` extracts `.vouchers`, and
  `src/review.ts`'s `NAME_FIELDS` list uses the real field names. Re-check
  this against the live server if `tally_prime_mcp_server` changes shape —
  the recorded fixtures do not update themselves.
- `src/vault.ts`'s `Vault.entries()` must return each alias in its original
  case (e.g. `"Creditor 1"`), not the lowercased lookup key used internally
  for case-insensitive `resolve()`. Getting this backwards silently breaks
  `demaskText` (the alias text in a masked finding/report never matches),
  which is exactly the de-masking path the trial balance report depends on.
- The masking group-name allowlist (`CLEAR_ROOTS`/`PRIMARY_GROUPS` in
  `src/classify.ts`) is asserted spelling, not yet verified against a live
  Tally company — see the design doc's "Verification against a live Tally"
  section. Do not trust it silently correct until that step has run.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
